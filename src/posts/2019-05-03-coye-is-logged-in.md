If you’ve watched Game of Thrones’ unmistakable opening credits, you’ve seen Ramin Djawadi’s name listed as the composer of the show’s music. But considering how active a participant that music has been in the story unfolding onscreen, perhaps he should be listed among the actors instead. “We always treated the music as another character on the show,” Djawadi says.

And what a cast he’s assembled. There’s the rousing whirl of the theme music, one of the show’s initial points of entry into the brains of millions of viewers. The mournful and ominous Lannister theme “The Rains of Castamere” became infamous as the world’s worst wedding song. The piano-based “Light of the Seven” popped up out of nowhere, after years of music with nary a tickle of ivory, to accompany Cersei’s destruction of her enemies in King’s Landing. These pivotal pieces are just a few of the highlights from Djawadi’s eight seasons of work providing HBO’s epic fantasy with an equally epic score.
